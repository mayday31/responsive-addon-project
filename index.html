            <h2>About DRAMA</h2>
            <p>
              DRAMA is an American duo from Chicago consisting of producer Na'el
              Shehade and vocalist/songwriter Via Rosa (born Lluvia Rosa Vela).
              The band is known for their independent approach to creating and
              releasing their music. Their debut album Dance Without Me was
              released in February 2020. Their most recent album, Platonic
              Romance, was released January 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drama's music has been described as "happy sad", characterized by
              Rosa's poignant lyrics about love and heartbreak designed for
              healing and catharsis, balanced out by Shehade's production
              featuring "throbbing synths and R&B." As they describe it, the
              duo's writing process involves Shehade accenting emotions evoked
              by Rosa's lyrics, which consist of revisiting past experiences to
              find new perspective.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I recently started learning how to code, and I've been enjoying it
              immensely! I've been using SheCodes to help me learn. My
              background is actually in Project Management, with a focus in risk
              management. This has been a learning curve for sure, and I'm glad
              to be learning a new skill.
